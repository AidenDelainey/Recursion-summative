Part 1
1. The difference is that the irritative code just gets the program ready while the recursive code does the rest of the heavy lifting
2. In procedural it is only gone over once but the recursive keeps calling itself until a condition is met.
3. Recursion calls upon itself while iteration just loops
Part 2
    Where would recursion be the best option?
It could be the best option when you want to make patterns that get smaller or bigger
    When would it not?
If you want a repeating hallway in a game because you need it to end at some point and it doesn’t need to change every time
    What are some specific examples of recursion that can work for you?
Making spirals or a quick countdown that i can input specific times into
